To determine the radius of a perfectly spherical asteroid, you need to calculate the cube root of its volume. Its mass in grams is explicitly recorded, and its density is a constant 4 g/cm³. First, calculate the volume (Volume = Mass / Density). Then, find the radius in centimeters (Radius = ∛(Volume)). Finally, convert this radius from centimeters to kilometers by dividing by 100,000 and report the final radius as an integer number of kilometers. What is the radius of asteroid K-909205941853764 in kilometers?",
